                <p> Cass has been a joy to work with. She goes out of her way for her clients (she brought me swig when we shot together!) and makes sure that you feel comfortable in front of the camera. She always captures your best angles, so every picture I feel confident and beautiful in. Honestly one of my absolute favorite people to work with and I trust her ability/talent so much!

                <p> Whenever we need an anniversary, pregnancy, or a birthday captured, Cassidy is our first choice! She always poses us in a natural and flattering way that allows our personalities to show. They are always freaking top quality!! She always gives us everything we ask for, even if our ideas are bad, she tries to make it work! She is the perfect balance between professional and personable! I highly recommend Cassidy!

                <p>  Cassidy is a true professional and a joy to work with. She had us laughing the whole time and isnâ€™t afraid to climb through several feet of snow to get the perfect shot. We couldnâ€™t have asked for a better experience and are thrilled with the images she sent us. ðŸ’•

                <p>   Cassidy did a phenomenal job on my wedding pictures! She was so accommodating and was able to get me in last second, even during corona! Her photos captured my day/ceremony so well and she caught moments I will cherish forever! Her prices are very fair and she is so nice to work with!

                <p>  Cassidy is so great! And made our photo shoot experience easy and fun! We took pictures for our baby announcements and loved it! Sheâ€™s everything you could ask for. Sheâ€™s professional, takes beautiful pictures, and make the experience light and fun she is also well prepared for the type of pictures your taking! There was no time wasted during our whole session. She made our quirky personalities look beautiful behind the camera.  Book with her! You wonâ€™t regret it!

                <p> Cassidy is one of the best photographers I have worked with! She is so kind and so professional and makes you feel comfortable in your own skin. We do a lot of creative shoots together and she brings incredible ideas to the table. She will help you with posing and angles to make you look best and she creates a fun environment. Her editing style is so dream like, clean, bright and beautiful! Cassidy is my #1 go to photographer. Take advantage of her amazing skills! I promise you wonâ€™t regret it!

                <p> Cassidy is SO FUN to work with!! Iâ€™ve done two shoots with her and both times i had a vision of what I wanted & she executed them both beautifully. Her turnaround time for delivering the photos is lightning fast & sheâ€™s just the nicest photographer youâ€™ll ever work with. Highly recommend!!

                <p> Cass does such amazing work! She has so much passion for getting all the right shots for all of her clients, you will not be disappointed with the work you get from her!

                <p> I would recommend Cassidy to anyone looking for a photographer! She made me and my husband feel 100% comfortable and happy to be in front of the camera. Which is a feat! Considering I was 7 months pregnant and not as confident as normal and my husband is very camera shy. She got our photos back to us super fast and we loved every single photo! I immediately shared them with our family because I was so happy with what Cassidy had done. :) 100000% would recommend!
